### Run the bridger

#### Configuration

`Bridger` depends on a configuration file, the default is `~/.bridger/config.toml`.

You don't need to manually create this file, it will be automatically generated by running any subcommand, such as the `bridger run`, `bridger keys`.

When you first run subcommand like ```bridger run```, it will generate an ```config.toml``` in ```~/.bridger```, you may need to config it to the right settings.

Here is an [sample](./.maintain/ropsten_crab_config.toml.sample) for bridgers which want to work on ropsten-crab bridge.
You can also read the more docs about the settings in the sample.

If you running for mainet, here is the [mainet sample](./.maintain/mainet_config.toml.sample) for reference.

You will need to prepare several services before using bridger:
- Darwinia node websocket json-rpc endpoint
- Ethereum json-rpc endpoint, e.g. [Infura](https://infura.io/)
- Darwinia Shadow http restful endpoint, for more details: https://github.com/darwinia-network/shadow
- Account Seed for signing extrinsics. You can use this account for `affirm` and `redeem`
  ```
  ...
  seed = '<account seed>'
  ...
  ```
- you can also using a proxy seed to signing extrinsic for your real account. To use proxy, you need to
    + Using [Extrinsic](https://apps.darwinia.network/#/extrinsics) to setting up the proxy using your real account. Calling ```proxy.addProxy(proxy_account, ProxyType.EthereumBridge, 0)```
    + Changing the seed settings to the proxy account's seed.
    + Make sure the proxy.real key in config.toml is set to the real account's address to enable proxy feature. (Currently must be public key hex format, Here is an [tool](https://crab.subscan.io/tools/ss58_transform) which can help address conversion.)

  ```
  ...
  seed = '<proxy account seed>'
  ...
  [proxy]
  real = '<real account public key>'
  ```

  If you are a member of the technical committee, This is the recommended. The proxy account can do `affirm`, `guard` and `redeem` for the real account.

#### Run

`bridger run` will run the bridger fully. You can also using ```bridger run -v``` to enter verbose model which can help print more trace logs.

`bridger guard` will run the guard service standalone.
